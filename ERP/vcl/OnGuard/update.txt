Electronic Maintenance System
Update Policies and Procedures

Quick start:
Copy and run this program in the directory where the original (unmodified) files are located. If any files are missing or have been modified, the patch will fail. If this happens re-install the library and run the patch again.

***IMPORTANT***
Be sure to remove any .DCU and .OBJ files prior to re-building the component library or compiling your projects, since these files could have a date later than the files that were patched.
***IMPORTANT***

Please note that the patch process does not register the components or re-install the help keyword file for Delphi 1 and 2. See the instructions in the manual (and possibly the readme.txt file) for information about installing the components and integrated help.  Components/Packages and help are installed automatically for Delphi 3 and C++Builder 3.

TurboPower Software provides maintenance updates of its products at no charge beyond the cost of a download. "Maintenance updates" are defined as those that change the version number in increments of 0.01. Updates of a larger degree must be purchased from TurboPower as usual. Maintenance updates are also available on disk from TurboPower for a nominal fee.

The maintenance updates are provided in the form of a patch generated by the Wise patch system. This system compares a group of files and generates a compressed list of differences in a single executable patch file. The patch file is much like a setup program except that the original files must be present on your hard drive in order for the patch to succeed.

A single patch program is capable of updating several minor versions at a time. For example, a patch program could update version 1.20 to version 1.25 but can not update version 1.20 to version 1.30 since the change from 1.2x to 1.3x is not a minor change.
